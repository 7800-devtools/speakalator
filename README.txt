speakalator v0.2 readme
-----------------------

speakalator is designed to interface with the SpeakJet chips by Magnevation. 
It's intended to be a substitute for the phrase editor in their own 
PhraseALator program, except it is open source and should run on unix type.

It requires a TTL level serial port to interface with the chip. See the 
SpeakJet documentation for more details.

This release is missing a few features, like a nice installer, different 
per-OS makefiles, configuration saving, etc. 

Great thanks is given to Fred Quimby! His text-to-phoneme implementation was 
graciously donated. With it, speakalator makes a best-guess at words not 
found in the PhraseALator dictionary.
